This is a workspace/environment for me to use rust implement the design patterns.
Rust is not a object-oriented language. So some design patterns may be useful or possible to implement in Rust.
And some patterns may have native support.
So it is more like proof of concept instead of something we could use in production.

# Introduction
According to [this book](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/), only very limited OOD design patterns are helpful in rust. And because of some features of the language, there could be new patterns or patterns from functional programming.

## Design Pattern Catelog(WIP)
### Creational Patterns
* Abstract Factory
* Factory Method
### Structural Patterns
* Bridge
* Composite
### Behavioral Patterns
